Water Castle: The lord of a forested, swampy region has grown old and feeble. Invaders appear from the woodlands, marshes and highlands near the castle to grab their share of the region's wealth.  The map has three possible start positions: in the outgrowths of the southern woods, in the middle swamps or in the northers hills. If players start in the south, most of their starting food is located in a clearing in the corner of the map. A nearby camp of bandits contains the area's gold. If players start in the middle and north they have standard starting resources. Another concentration of golds lies in front of the old lord's castle. The Fortress doesn't shoot the players.
