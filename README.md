3) Visit the working directory for AOE2 map scripts: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AoE2DE\resources_common\random-map-scripts
In its unmodified state, this directory will contain the original Ensemble Studios map scripts:

Move these scripts to their own subfolder or delete them:

This is necessary because if it is not done, an error will be thrown when attempting to clone the Github repository to this location:

At this time, you can create other folders in this location. For example, here is a directory configured with a “My_Workshop” folder that will not be monitored by Github. This is useful for private scripts/projects that you don’t want to share with the world:

Type in the following URL: https://github.com/TechnicalChariot/Age-of-Empires-II-Definitive-Edition----Random-Map-Scripts
Make sure that your Local path is set to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AoE2DE\resources\_common\random-map-scripts 
Hit “Clone”:

6) A few loading screens will process, and when completed, you should be able to visit:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AoE2DE\resources_common\random-map-scripts and confirm that an additional folder called “Age-of-Empires-II-Definitive-Edition----Random-Map-Scripts” has been added:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115369420/194993716-a83da5d6-69d8-49f6-80fc-866a374c8484.png)
Any folders or files you add to this folder will be tracked by Github and visible to any other collaborators of the repository. Happy scripting!
